#Analysis-of-CANDELS-residuals

guitemp-eventually will be a gui to easily classify good/bad residuals and insert the results into a csv file to later be used for analysis.

#M_GUI folder has the .py file, when it is placed in the same folder as the images and run will iterate automatically and will produce the csv file of classifications. At the moment it can also hand mis-clicks by destroying the entry for it. Needs some cleaning and documentation. On the lateset El Capitan Machine it is quitting without prompting the GUI. I will try to fix when i have time.
